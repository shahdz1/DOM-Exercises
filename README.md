### 🔹 Dice Game
A competitive two-player game where both players race to reach **100 points first**.

- Each player rolls the dice to collect points in their **current score**
- If the dice lands on **1**, the player **loses the current score** and the turn goes to the other player
- Players can “Hold” to safely add the current score to their total score
- First player to reach **100** wins
This project practices event handling, DOM updating, and game logic.
